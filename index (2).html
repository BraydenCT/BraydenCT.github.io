        <p class="lead mb-4">Objective:
I am seeking a position that utilizes my extensive swimming background and allows me to give back to the community. As a thoughtful problem-solver with a passion for social studies, I am eager to find opportunities to expand my knowledge and contribute meaningfully.

Education:
San Mateo High School, San Mateo, CA
Expected Graduation Date: May 2024
GPA: 3.6 unweighted / 3.8 weighted

Experience:
City of San Mateo Parks and Recreation - Green Teens Program (Summer 2022)
During the summer of 2022, I participated in the City of San Mateoâ€™s Green Teens Program, where I worked on projects to beautify local parks. My responsibilities included gardening, painting, and general maintenance. Through this role, I developed an appreciation for teamwork and learned how environmental stewardship positively impacts the community. I gained practical experience in landscaping and maintenance and learned to see the value of preserving outdoor spaces for all to enjoy.<br><br>

        Extracurricular Activities:

San Mateo Swim Team â€” Junior Varsity (2021-2023)
Swimming has been a significant part of my life and personal development. I was a dedicated member of the San Mateo High School junior varsity swim team for two years, from 2021 to 2023. The experience taught me the importance of discipline, time management, and resilience. I learned to balance the demands of schoolwork and training, enhancing my ability to manage multiple priorities effectively. Training and competing with the team also strengthened my understanding of collaboration, as each memberâ€™s effort is crucial to the overall performance.

Peninsula Jewish Community Center Swim Team - Gold Team Member (2017-2020)
Prior to joining my high school team, I was a member of the Peninsula Jewish Community Center (PJCC) Swim Team, where I achieved Gold Team status. This role required commitment, dedication, and a strong work ethic. Competing at a high level helped me build physical and mental strength, which I continue to rely on in my academic and extracurricular endeavors. My time on this team instilled a sense of discipline and has fueled my commitment to excellence.

San Mateo Samaritan House Volunteer (Summer 2022)
I also volunteered with the San Mateo Samaritan House, where I prepared meals and helped distribute groceries to families in need. This experience allowed me to witness firsthand the positive impact of community service and deepened my appreciation for volunteerism. Through this role, I improved my communication skills and gained a better understanding of the importance of food security and assistance programs. Working with the Samaritan House team was rewarding, and it confirmed my desire to continue serving my community.<br><br>

        Skills and Interests:
I am passionate about swimming, community service, and social studies. My experience with various swim teams has developed my perseverance, attention to detail, and ability to work well under pressure. My work with the Green Teens Program and Samaritan House strengthened my teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills. I am committed to personal growth and excited to pursue future opportunities where I can apply my skills in both athletics and social studies to make a meaningful difference.

I am excited to leverage my unique background in swimming, community service, and social studies in a role that combines my interests and values. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to grow and learn, and I look forward to making a positive impact in my next endeavor.
